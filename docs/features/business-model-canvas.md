## üß† AI Prompts & Templates

### Master Canvas Generation Prompt
```
You are an expert business strategist familiar with Alexander Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas (BMC), 
a strategic management template with nine defined building blocks.

Generate a comprehensive Business Model Canvas for the following app idea:
[APP_IDEA]

Context:
- Industry: [INDUSTRY]
- Target Market: [TARGET_MARKET]  
- Business Type: [B2B/B2C/B2B2C]

For each of the 9 BMC blocks, provide detailed, actionable content:

1. CUSTOMER SEGMENTS: Who are the target customers?
2. VALUE PROPOSITION: What unique value does the app provide?
3. CHANNELS: How will customers discover and access the app?
4. CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS: How will you build and maintain customer relationships?
5. REVENUE STREAMS: How will the app generate revenue?
6. KEY RESOURCES: What essential assets are needed?
7. KEY ACTIVITIES: What core operations must be performed?
8. KEY PARTNERSHIPS: What strategic alliances are needed?
9. COST STRUCTURE: What are the major costs?

Format as JSON with this structure:
{
  "customerSegments": "content",
  "valueProposition": "content",
  "channels": "content",
  "customerRelationships": "content", 
  "revenueStreams": "content",
  "keyResources": "content",
  "keyActivities": "content",
  "keyPartnerships": "content",
  "costStructure": "content"
}
```

### Individual Block Regeneration
For targeted improvements, the system uses context-aware prompts that consider existing blocks:

```
You are refining the [BLOCK_NAME] section of a Business Model Canvas.

Original App Idea: [APP_IDEA]
Current [BLOCK_NAME]: [CURRENT_CONTENT]

Context from other blocks:
- Customer Segments: [SEGMENTS]
- Value Proposition: [VALUE_PROP]
[... other relevant blocks]

Generate an improved version of [BLOCK_NAME] that:
1. Aligns with the existing canvas structure
2. Avoids duplication with other blocks
3. Provides specific, actionable insights
4. Maintains professional business language
```
